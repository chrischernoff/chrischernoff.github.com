I was hired to take part in a complete user experience overhaul for LogicBUY.com, a popular deals and coupons website. The site’s goal is to not only inform consumers of the greatest possible discounts available on the web, but to simplify the process of getting those discounts.

Over the past few years the site had accumulated a substantial amount of content, however it was struggling to keep users engaged and convert new users into returning users.

At the root of LogicBUY’s user experience woes was a user interface that was both visually unappealing and convoluted. I worked along side the visual design team to devise a strategy for the site that would not only look appealing, but also be enjoyable and easy to use.

The beginning of this process involved researching and analyzing LogicBUY’s many competitors to discover how their interfaces, designs, features, and other attributes added up and compared to LogicBUY’s user experience.

One challenge I faced during this process was how to address the different kinds of users LogicBUY has. While a veteran user might check the site religiously every hour and know how it works, another may have just happened across the site while looking for a coupon on Google. This meant that the site had to not only welcome and entice new users, but remain reserved enough so as to not seem trivial and long winded to veteran users.

It became clear that LogicBUY’s most successful competitors were those that used a careful blend of legibility, brevity, and speed. While some sites displayed more information for deals and coupons than others, generally speaking the ones that allowed users to more quickly and efficiently digest the content were the most successful.

I designed a navigation system for the site that quickly indicated to users what sort of content they could expect to find on LogicBUY. However the real heart of this website are the thousands of deal and coupon listings. In past iterations of the site, this information was muddled and not easy to browse through. Therefore, special thought was given to the deal "unit" this information was organized into. At a glance, each listing had to be interesting and informative, but not be overly congested with unnecessary content.

A new grid view provided an organized way to show deals on the site. Upon hover, a deal in the grid could be expanded to reveal additional details. Meanwhile in the list view, all entries were streamlined to provide maximum scanabilty at first glance, but still be able to provide necessary details to users who were interested.

Due to the fact that a “good” deal is often relative, another key area of the site that was addressed was how users affected content on the site. By using new voting, commenting, and tagging tools, LogicBUY's dedicated community could self-curate many of the deals and coupons that would come about during each day.

My involvement with LogicBUY continued through three phases of feature sets and deployment. Over the course of this progression, the client began to truly trust my opinion and expertise, eventually deferring onto my shoulders most of the key decisions that would make or break their business.

As a result of the hard work put into this project, LogicBUY has seen a significant statistical increase in nearly every measurable analytics category, from their unique visitors (tripled) to time on site (more than doubled). User registration and user submissions increased dramatically due to the more streamlined processes, and LogicBUY has received awards for Best Deals Site, beating out industry mainstays such as DealNews and SlickDeals.
