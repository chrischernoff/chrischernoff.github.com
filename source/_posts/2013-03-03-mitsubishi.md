Mitsubishi had a predicament. They built reliable well performing cars, but in recent years have been a sort of "also ran" in the Japanese import market. Sure you may have heard hubbub about something called an “Evo”, or stories of people like your uncle driving their old Monteros off 10 foot cliffs and they're still running. However for the most part, Mitsubishi generally isn't a brand that comes to mind when people are thinking about buying a car.

Despite being Mitsubishi’s biggest selling tool, their website wasn’t helping their cause. I was brought on to try to fix this problem.

Knowing that a company like Mitsubishi draws a wide variety of customers, I conducted user tests to get a handle on what some of the problems with their site were. In addition to my own observations and suspicions, my pool of test subjects uncovered many troubling aspects. I combined these findings with my own user tests and research of other car manufacturer websites to determine key areas in need of improvement.

A staple in all car manufacturer sites these days is a build and price tool. By being able to appoint a car with only the features they need, users are able to construct a clear idea of how much money they will need to buy a car. While Mitsubishi did have a build and price tool on their site, a confusing selection process coupled with a funky progress indicator caused many users to become frustrated and leave.

Cars and car advertisements are meant to convey messages and feelings such as “bold” or “elegant”, but the build and price tool needed one thing: transparency. By pigeonholing key information about the cars, the current tool lacked any sense of honesty or completion. People rarely notice when they are presented with all the information they need and are able to easily access it. However as soon as certain items and functionalities are removed, comfort quickly turns into frustration. I added transparency to the build and price tool in a number of different ways.

The first problem most prospective car buyers encountered is that they simply don’t know what kind of car suits them best. The revamped build tool allowed users to filter the vehicle lineup by a variety of parameters. If they still had difficulty deciding on a model, colors, options, and other details, the site helped them pose questions to their friends via social media on what car or color to choose.

I added a receipt system to keep track of what was being added to the car, and how much each item cost. Next, I added a progress tracker to indicate how far along in the building process a user was. I studied the visual language of e-commerce checkout processes and decided that by adding a step-by-step tracker at the top, users would gain a sense of accomplishment for completing the build process. A continuously updating estimated monthly payment module was another feature that added a critical point of reference. Unless they are paying in cash, nearly all users want to know what a car will cost monthly.

Finally, I allowed users to click on any term throughout the process to reveal what it meant in greater detail. Many users do not know much about cars or their underlying technologies. Testing showed that when presented with a list of options to choose from, users who knew less about cars gave up because they did not know what certain things were. By including descriptions of all the technology on the car, more users could confidently continue on.

Another area of the Mitsubishi site that was severely lacking was their owners section. While car companies insist on “welcoming you into the family” right as you’re about to sign on the dotted line, you rarely feel the love after you’ve been thrown the keys. Whether you’re just trying to find out where your oil cap is, or where to go for your next service, it was clear that Mitsubishi needed to beef up their owners section.

In addition to vehicle information, the owners section would also help facilitate conversations and meetings between owners. Every year millions of people sign on to car forums, go to auto expos, and head to the track. Mitsubishi should be the collecting point for many of these people who share the same interests. By leveraging vehicle and location specific information, the site populated a calendar of events to suit each owners needs, and remind them of when they are on their mobile phone.
